  template <class T>                                               (ranges TS)
  concept bool Regular = Semiregular<T> && EqualityComparable<T>;

  The Regular concept specifies that a type is regular, that is, it is copyable, default constructible, and equality comparable. It is satisfied by types that behave similarly to built-in types like int, and that are comparable with ==.
