.TH std::basic_filebuf<CharT,Traits>::sync 3 "2020.03.24" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::basic_filebuf<CharT,Traits>::sync \- std::basic_filebuf<CharT,Traits>::sync

.SH Synopsis

protected:
virtual int sync()

If a put area exists (e.g. the file was opened for writing), calls overflow() to write all pending output to the file, then flushes the file as if by calling std::fflush.
If a get area exists (e.g. the file was opened for reading), the effect is implementation-defined. Typical implementation may empty out the get area and move the current file position back by the corresponding number of bytes.

.SH Parameters

\fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

0 in case of success, -1 in case of failure.

.SH Notes

sync() or its equivalent is implicitly called for output streams by close(), seekoff(), and seekpos() and explicitly called by std::basic_streambuf::pubsync()
