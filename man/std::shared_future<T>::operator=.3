.SH Synopsis

  shared_future& operator=( const shared_future& other );                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
                                                                   \fB(1)\fP     \fI(until C++17)\fP
  shared_future& operator=( const shared_future& other ) noexcept;         \fI(since C++17)\fP
  shared_future& operator=( shared_future&& other ) noexcept;          \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

  Assigns the contents of another shared_future.
  1) Releases any shared state and assigns the contents of other to *this. After the assignment, this->valid() == other.valid().
  2) Releases any shared state and move-assigns the contents of other to *this. After the assignment, other.valid() == false and this->valid() will yield the same value as other.valid() before the assignment.

.SH Parameters


  other - a std::shared_future that will transfer state to *this


.SH Return value

  *this
