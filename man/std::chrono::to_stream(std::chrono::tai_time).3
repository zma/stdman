.SH Synopsis
   template <class CharT, class Traits, class Duration>

   std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&                                  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   to_stream(std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os, const CharT* fmt,

   const std::chrono::tai_time<Duration>& tp);

   Outputs tp to the stream os, formatted according to the null-terminated format string fmt. If %Z is used, it is replaced with "TAI" widened to CharT. If %z or a modified variant thereof is used, an offset of 0min will be formatted. The date and time formatted are equivalent to that formatted for a std::chrono::sys_time initialized with std::chrono::sys_time<Duration>(tp.time_since_epoch()) - std::chrono::days(4383).

  Format string

   The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary characters. All ordinary characters, excluding the terminating null character, are written into the output stream without modification. Each unmodified conversion specifier begins with a % character followed by a character that determines the behavior of the specifier. Some conversion specifiers have a modified form in which an E or O modifier character is inserted after the % character. Each conversion specifier is replaced by appropriate characters in the output as described below.

   A character sequence in the format string that begins with a % but does not match one of the format specifiers below is interpreted as ordinary characters.

   The following format specifiers are available:
