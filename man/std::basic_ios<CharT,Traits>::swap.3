.SH NAME
std::basic_ios<CharT,Traits>::swap \- std::basic_ios<CharT,Traits>::swap

.SH Synopsis

  protected:                               \fI(since C++11)\fP
  void swap( basic_ios& other ) noexcept;

  Exchanges the states of *this and other, except for the associated rdbuf objects. rdbuf() and other.rdbuf() returns the same values as before the call.
  This swap function is protected: it is called by the swap member functions of the derived stream classes such as std::basic_ofstream or std::basic_istringstream, which know how to correctly swap the associated streambuffers.

.SH Parameters


  other - the basic_ios object to exchange the state with


.SH Return value

  \fI(none)\fP
