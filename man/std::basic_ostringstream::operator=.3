.SH Synopsis

  basic_ostringstream& operator=( basic_ostringstream&& other );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

  Move assigns the string stream other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the std::basic_ostream base class and the associated std::basic_stringbuf.
  Note that the base class move assignment swaps all stream state variables (except for rdbuf) between *this and other.
