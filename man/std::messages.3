.SH Synopsis

Defined in header <locale>
template< class CharT >
class messages;

Class template std::messages is a standard locale facet that encapsulates retrieval of strings from message catalogs, such as the ones provided by GNU gettext or by POSIX catgets.
The source of the messages is implementation-defined.

Inheritance diagram
Two standalone (locale-independent) specializations are provided by the standard library:

Defined in header <locale>
std::messages<char>    accesses narrow string message catalog
std::messages<wchar_t> accesses wide string message catalog

In addition, every locale object constructed in a C++ program implements its own (locale-specific) versions of these specializations.
