.SH NAME
std::experimental::filesystem::directory_options \- std::experimental::filesystem::directory_options

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>
   enum class directory_options {

   none,
   follow_directory_symlink,                    (filesystem TS)
   skip_permission_denied

   };

   This type represents available options that control the behavior of the directory_iterator and recursive_directory_iterator.

   directory_options satisfies the requirements of BitmaskType (which means the bitwise operators operator&, operator|, operator^, operator~, operator&=, operator|=, and operator^= are defined for this type)

.SH Member constants
