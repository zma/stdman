.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::Copyable \- std::experimental::ranges::Copyable

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template <class T>

   concept bool Copyable =
   CopyConstructible<T> &&                           (ranges TS)
   Movable<T> &&

   Assignable<T&, const T&>;

   The concept Copyable<T> specifies that T is an Movable object type that can also copied (that is, it supports copy construction and copy assignment).

.SH Notes

   It is intended that Copyable<T> also requires Assignable<T&, const T> (assignment from const rvalue) and Assignable<T&, T&> (assignment from non-const lvalue) to be satisfied.
