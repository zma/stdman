.SH NAME
std::polar(std::complex) \- std::polar(std::complex)

.SH Synopsis

Defined in header <complex>
template< class T >
complex<T> polar( const T& r, const T& theta = T());

Returns a complex number with magnitude r and phase angle theta.
The behavior is undefined if r is negative or NaN, or if theta is infinite.

.SH Parameters


r     - magnitude
theta - phase angle


.SH Return value

a complex number determined by r and theta
