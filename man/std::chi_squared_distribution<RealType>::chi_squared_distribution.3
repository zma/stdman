.SH NAME
std::chi_squared_distribution<RealType>::chi_squared_distribution \- std::chi_squared_distribution<RealType>::chi_squared_distribution

.SH Synopsis

chi_squared_distribution() : chi_squared_distribution(1.0) {}  \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
explicit chi_squared_distribution( RealType n );               \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
explicit chi_squared_distribution( const param_type& params ); \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

Constructs a new distribution object. \fB(2)\fP uses n as the distribution parameter. \fB(3)\fP uses params as the distribution parameter.

.SH Parameters


n      - the n distribution parameter (degrees of freedom)
params - the distribution parameter set
