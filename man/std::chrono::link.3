.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class link;                 \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The class link represents an alternative name for a time zone.

   Users cannot construct link objects. The library implementation creates link objects when it initializes the time zone database and provides const access to these objects.

   link is not copyable but does have a defaulted move constructor and a defaulted move assignment operator. However, as users have only const access to link objects, these functions cannot be called in user code without invoking undefined behavior.
