.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   template<

   class Rep,                    \fI(since C++11)\fP
   class Period = std::ratio<1>

   > class duration;

   Class template std::chrono::duration represents a time interval.

   It consists of a count of ticks of type Rep and a tick period, where the tick period is a compile-time rational constant representing the number of seconds from one tick to the next.

   The only data stored in a duration is a tick count of type Rep. If Rep is floating point, then the duration can represent fractions of ticks. Period is included as part of the duration's type, and is only used when converting between different durations.

.SH Example

   This example shows how to define several custom duration types and convert between types:

   
// Run this code

 #include <iostream>
 #include <chrono>

 constexpr auto year = 31556952ll; // seconds in average Gregorian year

 int main()
 {
     using shakes = std::chrono::duration<int, std::ratio<1, 100000000>>;
     using jiffies = std::chrono::duration<int, std::centi>;
     using microfortnights = std::chrono::duration<float, std::ratio<14*24*60*60, 1000000>>;
     using nanocenturies = std::chrono::duration<float, std::ratio<100*year, 1000000000>>;

     std::chrono::seconds sec(1);

     std::cout << "1 second is:\\n";

     // integer scale conversion with no precision loss: no cast
     std::cout << std::chrono::microseconds(sec).count() << " microseconds\\n"
               << shakes(sec).count() << " shakes\\n"
               << jiffies(sec).count() << " jiffies\\n";

     // integer scale conversion with precision loss: requires a cast
     std::cout << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::minutes>(sec).count()
               << " minutes\\n";

     // floating-point scale conversion: no cast
     std::cout << microfortnights(sec).count() << " microfortnights\\n"
               << nanocenturies(sec).count() << " nanocenturies\\n";
 }

.SH Output:

 1 second is:
 1000000 microseconds
 100000000 shakes
 100 jiffies
 0 minutes
 0.82672 microfortnights
 0.316887 nanocenturies
