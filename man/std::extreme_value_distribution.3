.SH NAME
std::extreme_value_distribution \- std::extreme_value_distribution

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <random>
  template< class RealType = double >  \fI(since C++11)\fP
  class extreme_value_distribution;

  Produces random numbers according to the extreme_value_distribution (it is also known as Gumbel Type I, log-Weibull, Fisher-Tippett Type I):

        p(x;a,b) =

        1
        b

        exp⎛
        ⎜
        ⎝

        a-x
        b

        - exp⎛
        ⎜
        ⎝

        a-x
        b

        ⎞
        ⎟
        ⎠⎞
        ⎟
        ⎠

  std::extreme_value_distribution satisfies all requirements of RandomNumberDistribution

.SH Template parameters


  RealType - The result type generated by the generator. The effect is undefined if this is not one of float, double, or long double.



.SH Member types


  Member type Definition
  result_type RealType
  param_type  the type of the parameter set, see RandomNumberDistribution.


.SH Member functions


                constructs new distribution
  constructor   \fI(public member function)\fP
                resets the internal state of the distribution
  reset         \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Generation

                generates the next random number in the distribution
  operator()    \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Characteristics

                returns the distribution parameters
  a             \fI(public member function)\fP
  b
                gets or sets the distribution parameter object
  param         \fI(public member function)\fP
                returns the minimum potentially generated value
  min           \fI(public member function)\fP
                returns the maximum potentially generated value
  max           \fI(public member function)\fP


.SH Non-member functions


             compares two distribution objects
  operator== \fI(function)\fP
  operator!=
             performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number distribution
  operator<< \fI(function template)\fP
  operator>>
