.SH NAME
std::floor2 \- std::floor2

.SH Synopsis

Defined in header <bit>
template< class T >                \fI(since C++20)\fP
constexpr T floor2(T x) noexcept;

If x is not zero, calculates the largest integral power of two that is not greater than x. If x is zero, returns zero.
This overload only participates in overload resolution if T is an unsigned integer type (that is, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, unsigned long long, or an extended unsigned integer type).

.SH Return value

Zero if x is zero; otherwise, the largest integral power of two that is not greater than x.
