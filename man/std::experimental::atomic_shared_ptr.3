.SH NAME
std::experimental::atomic_shared_ptr \- std::experimental::atomic_shared_ptr

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/atomic>
   template < class T >                     (concurrency TS)
   class atomic_shared_ptr;

   The class template atomic_shared_ptr provides thread-safe atomic pointer operations over a std::shared_ptr. It provides a better alternative to the non-member shared_ptr atomic access functions.

.SH Member functions

   constructor             constructs an atomic_shared_ptr object
                           \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator=               stores a value into an atomic_shared_ptr object
                           \fI(public member function)\fP
   is_lock_free            checks if the atomic_shared_ptr object is lock-free
                           \fI(public member function)\fP
   store                   atomically replaces the value of the atomic object with a non-atomic argument
                           \fI(public member function)\fP
   load                    atomically obtains the value of the atomic object
                           \fI(public member function)\fP
   operator shared_ptr<T>  loads a value from an atomic object
                           \fI(public member function)\fP
   exchange                atomically replaces the value of the atomic object and obtains the value held previously
                           \fI(public member function)\fP
   compare_exchange_weak   atomically compares the value of the atomic object with non-atomic argument and performs atomic exchange if equal or atomic load if not
   compare_exchange_strong \fI(public member function)\fP
