.SH NAME
std::experimental::basic_string_view<CharT,Traits>::find \- std::experimental::basic_string_view<CharT,Traits>::find

.SH Synopsis

  constexpr size_type find(basic_string_view v, size_type pos = 0) const noexcept; \fB(1)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
  constexpr size_type find(CharT c, size_type pos = 0) const noexcept;             \fB(2)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
  constexpr size_type find(const CharT* s, size_type pos, size_type count) const;  \fB(3)\fP (library fundamentals TS)
  constexpr size_type find(const CharT* s, size_type pos = 0) const;               \fB(4)\fP (library fundamentals TS)

  Finds the first substring equal to the given character sequence.
  1) Finds the first occurence of v in this view, starting at position pos.
  2) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(&c, 1), pos).
  3) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).
  4) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(s), pos).

.SH Parameters


  v     - view to search for
  pos   - position at which to start the search
  count - length of substring to search for
  s     - pointer to a character string to search for
  ch    - character to search for



.SH Return value

  Position of the first character of the found substring, or npos if no such substring is found.

.SH Complexity

  O(size() * v.size()) at worst.
