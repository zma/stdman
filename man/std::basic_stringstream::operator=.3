std::basic_stringstream::operator= \- std::basic_stringstream::operator=

.SH Synopsis

basic_stringstream& operator=( basic_stringstream&& other );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

Move assigns the string stream other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the std::basic_iostream base class and the associated std::basic_stringbuf.
Note that the base class move assignment swaps all stream state variables (except for rdbuf) between *this and other.
