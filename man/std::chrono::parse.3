   Returns an object manip of unspecified type such that, given a std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits> object is, the expression is >> manip calls from_stream (unqualified, to enable argument-dependent lookup) as follows:

   1) from_stream(is, fmt.c_str(), tp)
   2) from_stream(is, fmt.c_str(), tp, std::addressof(abbrev))
   3) from_stream(is, fmt.c_str(), tp, nullptr, &offset)
   4) from_stream(is, fmt.c_str(), tp, std::addressof(abbrev), &offset).

   The expression is >> manip is an lvalue of type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits> with the value is.

   These overloads only participate in overload resolution if the corresponding from_stream expression is well-formed.

  Format string

   The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and ordinary characters. Each ordinary character, excluding whitespace characters and the terminating null character, matches one identical character from the input stream, or causes the function to fail if the next character on the stream does not compare equal.

   Each whitespace character matches zero or more whitespace characters in the input stream.

   Each unmodified conversion specifier begins with a % character followed by a character that determines the behavior of the specifier. Some conversion specifiers have a modified form in which an E or O modifier character is inserted after the % character. Some conversion specifiers have a modified form in which a width parameter given as a positive decimal integer (shown as N below) is inserted after the % character. Each conversion specifier causes the matched characters to be interpreted as parts of date and time types according to the table below.

   A character sequence in the format string that begins with a % but does not match one of the conversion specifiers below is interpreted as ordinary characters.

   If from_stream fails to parse everything specified by the format string, or if insufficient information is parsed to specify a complete result, or if parsing discloses contradictory information, is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit) is called.

   The following conversion specifiers are available:
