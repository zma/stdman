.SH NAME
std::basic_osyncstream<CharT,Traits,Allocator>::operator= \- std::basic_osyncstream<CharT,Traits,Allocator>::operator=

.SH Synopsis

  basic_osyncstream& operator=( std::basic_osyncstream&& other) noexcept;

  Move-assigns a synchronized output stream:
  First, calls emit(). If an exception is thrown by the call to emit(), it is caught and ignored.
  Then, move-assigns the wrapped std::basic_syncbuf from the corresponding member of other (after this move-assignment, other.get_wrapped() returns a null pointer and destruction of other produces no output) and move-assigns the base std::basic_ostream (this swaps all stream state variables except for rdbuf between *this and other)

.SH Parameters


  other - another osyncstream to move from
