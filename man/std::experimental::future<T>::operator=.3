.SH Synopsis
   std::experimental::future<T>& operator=( std::experimental::future<T>&& other ) noexcept;      \fB(1)\fP
   std::experimental::future<T>& operator=( const std::experimental::future<T>& other ) = delete; \fB(2)\fP

   Assigns the contents of another future object.

   1) Releases any shared state and move-assigns the contents of other to *this. After the assignment, other.valid() == false and this->valid() will yield the same value as other.valid() before the assignment.

   2) std::experimental::future is not CopyAssignable.

.SH Parameters

   other - a std::experimental::future that will transfer state to *this

.SH Return value

   *this
