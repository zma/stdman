.SH NAME
std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T>::deallocate_object \- std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T>::deallocate_object

.SH Synopsis
   template <class U>                                  \fI(since C++20)\fP
   void deallocate_object( U* p, std::size_t n = 1 );

   Deallocates the storage pointed to by p, which must have been allocated from a std::pmr::memory_resource x that compares equal to *resource(). using x.allocate(n*sizeof(U), alignof(U)), typically through a call to allocate_object<U>(n).

   Equivalent to deallocate_bytes(p, n*sizeof(U), alignof(U));

.SH Parameters

   p - pointer to memory to deallocate
   n - number of objects of type U the memory was for

.SH Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

.SH Notes

   This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator std::polymorphic_allocator<>, but it may be useful in any specialization.
