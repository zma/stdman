.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <experimental/filesystem>
  enum class directory_options {
  none,
  follow_directory_symlink,                    (filesystem TS)
  skip_permission_denied
  };

  This type represents available options that control the behavior of the directory_iterator and recursive_directory_iterator.
  directory_options satisfies the requirements of BitmaskType (which means the bitwise operators operator&, operator|, operator^, operator~, operator&=, operator|=, and operator^= are defined for this type)
