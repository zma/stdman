.SH Example


// Run this code

  #include <thread>
  #include <iostream>
  #include <system_error>

  int main()
  {
      try {
          std::thread().detach(); // attempt to detach a non-thread
      } catch(const std::system_error& e) {
          std::cout << "Caught system_error with code " << e.code()
                    << " meaning " << e.what() << '\\n';
      }
  }
