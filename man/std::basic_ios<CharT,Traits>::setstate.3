.SH NAME
std::basic_ios<CharT,Traits>::setstate \- std::basic_ios<CharT,Traits>::setstate

.SH Synopsis

  void setstate( iostate state );

  Sets the stream error flags state in addition to currently set flags. Essentially calls clear(rdstate() | state). May throw an exception.

.SH Parameters


          stream error state flags to set. It can be a combination of the following constants:

          Constant Explanation
          goodbit  no error
  state - badbit   irrecoverable stream error
          failbit  input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error)
          eofbit   associated input sequence has reached end-of-file




.SH Return value

  \fI(none)\fP

.SH Example

  
// Run this code

    #include <iostream>
    #include <sstream>

    int main()
    {
        std::ostringstream stream;

        if (!stream.fail()) {
            std::cout << "stream is not fail\\n";
        }

        stream.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit);

        if (stream.fail()) {
            std::cout << "now stream is fail\\n";
        }

        if (!stream.good()) {
            std::cout << "and stream is not good\\n";
        }
    }

.SH Output:

    stream is not fail
    now stream is fail
    and stream is not good
