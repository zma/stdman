.SH Synopsis

Defined in header <chrono>
class utc_clock;            \fI(since C++20)\fP

The clock std::chrono::utc_clock is a Clock that represents Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It measures time since 00:00:00 UTC, Thursday, 1 January 1970, including leap seconds.
utc_clock meets the Clock requirements. It does not meet the TrivialClock requirements unless the implementation can guarantee that now() does not throw an exception.

.SH Member types


Member type Definition
rep         signed arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's duration
period      a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds
duration    std::chrono::duration<rep, period>, capable of representing negative durations
time_point  std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::utc_clock>


.SH Member constants



constexpr bool is_steady true if the time between ticks is always constant, i.e. calls to now() return values that increase monotonically even in case of some external clock adjustment, otherwise false
