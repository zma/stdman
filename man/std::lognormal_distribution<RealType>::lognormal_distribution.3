.SH NAME
std::lognormal_distribution<RealType>::lognormal_distribution \- std::lognormal_distribution<RealType>::lognormal_distribution

.SH Synopsis

lognormal_distribution() : lognormal_distribution(0.0) {}        \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
explicit lognormal_distribution( RealType m, RealType s = 1.0 ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
explicit lognormal_distribution( const param_type& params );     \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

Constructs a new distribution object. \fB(2)\fP uses m and s as the distribution parameters. \fB(3)\fP uses params as the distribution parameters.

.SH Parameters


m      - the m distribution parameter (log-scale)
s      - the s distribution parameter (shape)
params - the distribution parameter set
