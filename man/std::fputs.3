.TH std::fputs 3 "2020.03.24" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::fputs \- std::fputs

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <cstdio>
  int fputs( const char* str, std::FILE* stream );

  Writes every character from the null-terminated string str to the output stream stream, as if by repeatedly executing std::fputc.
  The terminating null character from str is not written.

.SH Parameters


  str    - null-terminated character string to be written
  stream - output stream


.SH Return value

  On success, returns a non-negative value
  On failure, returns EOF and sets the error indicator (see std::ferror) on stream.

.SH Notes

  The related function std::puts appends a newline character to the output, while std::fputs writes the string unmodified.
  Different implementations return different non-negative numbers: some return the last character written, some return the number of characters written (or INT_MAX if the string was longer than that), some simply return a non-negative constant such as zero.

.SH Example

  
// Run this code

    #include <cstdio>

    int main(void)
    {
        int rc = std::fputs("Hello World", stdout);

        if (rc == EOF)
           std::perror("fputs()"); // POSIX requires that errno is set
    }

.SH Output:

    Hello World
