.SH NAME
std::exponential_distribution<RealType>::exponential_distribution \- std::exponential_distribution<RealType>::exponential_distribution

.SH Synopsis

  exponential_distribution() : exponential_distribution(1.0) {}  \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
  explicit exponential_distribution( RealType lambda );          \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
  explicit exponential_distribution( const param_type& params ); \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

  Constructs a new distribution object. \fB(2)\fP uses lambda as the distribution parameter. \fB(3)\fP uses params as the distribution parameter.

.SH Parameters


  lambda - the Î» distribution parameter (the rate parameter)
  params - the distribution parameter set


.SH Notes

  Requires that 0 < lambda.
