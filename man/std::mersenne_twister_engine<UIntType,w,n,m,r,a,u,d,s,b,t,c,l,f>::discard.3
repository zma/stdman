.SH NAME
std::mersenne_twister_engine<UIntType,w,n,m,r,a,u,d,s,b,t,c,l,f>::discard \- std::mersenne_twister_engine<UIntType,w,n,m,r,a,u,d,s,b,t,c,l,f>::discard

.SH Synopsis

  void discard( unsigned long long z );  \fI(since C++11)\fP

  Advances the internal state by z times. Equivalent to calling operator() z times and discarding the result

.SH Parameters


  z - integer value specifying the number of times to advance the state by


.SH Return value

  \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity


   This section is incomplete


.SH Notes

  For some engines, "fast jump" algorithms are known, which advance the state by many steps (order of millions) without calculating intermediate state transitions, although not necessarily in constant time.
