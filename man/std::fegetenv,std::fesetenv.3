.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <cfenv>
  int fegetenv( std::fenv_t* envp )        \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
  int fesetenv( const std::fenv_t* envp ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

  Manages the status of the floating-point environment.
  1) Attempts to store the status of the floating-point environment in the object pointed to by envp.
  2) Attempts to establish the floating-point environment from the object pointed to by envp. The value of that object must be previously obtained by a call to std::feholdexcept or std::fegetenv or be a floating-point macro constant. If any of the floating-point status flags are set in envp, they become set in the environment (and are then testable with std::fetestexcept), but the corresponding floating-point exceptions are not raised (execution continues uninterrupted)

.SH Parameters


  envp - pointer to the object of type std::fenv_t which holds the status of the floating-point environment


.SH Return value

  0 on success, non-zero otherwise.
