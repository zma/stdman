std::basic_string_view<CharT,Traits>::rfind \- std::basic_string_view<CharT,Traits>::rfind

.SH Synopsis

constexpr size_type rfind(basic_string_view v, size_type pos = npos) const noexcept; \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
constexpr size_type rfind(CharT c, size_type pos = npos) const noexcept;             \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
constexpr size_type rfind(const CharT* s, size_type pos, size_type count) const;     \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
constexpr size_type rfind(const CharT* s, size_type pos = npos) const;               \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP

Finds the last substring equal to the given character sequence.
1) Finds the last occurence of v in this view, starting at position pos.
2) Equivalent to rfind(basic_string_view(std::addressof(c), 1), pos).
3) Equivalent to rfind(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).
4) Equivalent to rfind(basic_string_view(s), pos).

.SH Parameters


v     - view to search for
pos   - position at which to start the search
count - length of substring to search for
s     - pointer to a character string to search for
ch    - character to search for



.SH Return value

Position of the first character of the found substring or npos if no such substring is found.

.SH Complexity

O(size() * v.size()) at worst.
