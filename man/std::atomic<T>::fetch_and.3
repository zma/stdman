.SH Synopsis

T fetch_and( T arg,
std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) noexcept;           \fI(since C++11)\fP
T fetch_and( T arg,                                                       (member only of atomic<Integral> template specialization)
std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) volatile noexcept;

Atomically replaces the current value with the result of bitwise AND of the value and arg. The operation is read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

.SH Parameters


arg   - the other argument of bitwise AND
order - memory order constraints to enforce


.SH Return value

The value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification_order of *this.
