.SH NAME
std::geometric_distribution<IntType>::geometric_distribution \- std::geometric_distribution<IntType>::geometric_distribution

.SH Synopsis

geometric_distribution() : geometric_distribution(0.5) {}    \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
explicit geometric_distribution( double p );                 \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
explicit geometric_distribution( const param_type& params ); \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

Constructs a new distribution object. \fB(2)\fP uses p as the distribution parameter. \fB(3)\fP uses params as the distribution parameter.

.SH Parameters


p      - the p distribution parameter (probability of a trial generating true)
params - the distribution parameter set


.SH Notes

Requires that 0 < p < 1
