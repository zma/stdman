.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class system_clock;         \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Class std::chrono::system_clock represents the system-wide real time wall clock.

   It may not be monotonic: on most systems, the system time can be adjusted at any moment. It is the only C++ clock that has the ability to map its time points to C-style time
   , and, therefore, to be displayed
   \fI(until C++20)\fP.

   std::chrono::system_clock meets the requirements of TrivialClock.

   The epoch of system_clock is unspecified, but most implementations use Unix Time (i.e., time since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970, not counting leap seconds). \fI(until C++20)\fP
   system_clock measures Unix Time (i.e., time since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970, not counting leap seconds).                                                  \fI(since C++20)\fP

   to_stream (std::chrono::sys_time)   outputs a sys_time into a stream according to the provided format

.SH Member types

   Member type Definition
   rep         signed arithmetic type representing the number of ticks in the clock's duration
   period      a std::ratio type representing the tick period of the clock, in seconds
   duration    std::chrono::duration<rep, period>, capable of representing negative durations
   time_point  std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock>

.SH Member constants

   constexpr bool is_steady true if the time between ticks is always constant, i.e. calls to now() return values that increase monotonically even in case of some external clock adjustment, otherwise false

.SH Member functions

   now         returns a std::chrono::time_point representing the current point in time
