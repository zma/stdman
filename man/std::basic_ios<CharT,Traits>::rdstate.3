.SH NAME
std::basic_ios<CharT,Traits>::rdstate \- std::basic_ios<CharT,Traits>::rdstate

.SH Synopsis

iostate rdstate() const;

Returns the current stream error state.

.SH Parameters

\fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

current stream error state. It is a bitmask type and can be a combination of the following constants:

Constant Explanation
goodbit  no error
badbit   irrecoverable stream error
failbit  input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error)
eofbit   associated input sequence has reached end-of-file


.SH Example


// Run this code

  #include <iostream>
  #include <sstream>

  int main()
  {
    std::ostringstream stream;

    if (stream.rdstate() == std::ios_base::goodbit) {
      std::cout << "stream state is goodbit\\n";
    }

    stream.setstate(std::ios_base::eofbit);

    // check state is exactly eofbit (no failbit and no badbit)
    if (stream.rdstate() == std::ios_base::eofbit) {
      std::cout << "stream state is eofbit\\n";
    }
  }

.SH Output:

  stream state is goodbit
  stream state is eofbit
