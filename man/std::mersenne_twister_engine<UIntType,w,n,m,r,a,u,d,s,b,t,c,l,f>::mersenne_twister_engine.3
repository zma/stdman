Constructs the pseudo-random number engine.
1) Default constructor. Seeds the engine with default_seed.
2) Constructs the engine and initializes the state (n values X
i of type result_type) as follows: value mod 2w
is used to initialize X
0 and the rest are initialized iteratively, for i=1-n,...,-1, each X
i is initialized to [f·(X
i-1xor(X
i-1rshift(w-2)))+i mod n] mod 2w
3) Constructs the engine and initializes the state by calling s.generate(a, a+n*k) where a is an array of length n*k and k is ceil(w/32) and then, iteratively for i=-n,...,-1, setting each element of the engine state X
i to (Σk-1
j=0a
k(i+n)+j}·232j
) mod 2w
, and finally if the most significant w-r bits of X
0 are zero, and if all other X
i are zero, replacing X
0 with 2w-1
.
Note: initialization requirements are based on the 2002 version of Mersenne Twister, mt19937ar.c
The overload \fB(3)\fP only participates in overload resolution if Sseq qualifies as a SeedSequence. In particular, it is excluded from the set of candidate functions if Sseq is convertible to result_type.

.SH Parameters


value - seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state
s     - seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state


.SH Complexity

linear in n (the state size)
