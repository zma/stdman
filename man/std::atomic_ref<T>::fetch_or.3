.SH NAME
std::atomic_ref<T>::fetch_or \- std::atomic_ref<T>::fetch_or

.SH Synopsis
   T fetch_or( T arg,                                                     \fI(since C++20)\fP
   std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const noexcept;  (member only of atomic_ref<Integral> template specialization)

   Atomically replaces the current value of the referenced object with the result of bitwise OR of the value and arg. This operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

.SH Parameters

   arg   - the other argument of bitwise OR
   order - memory order constraints to enforce

.SH Return value

   The value of the referenced object, immediately preceding the effects of this function.
