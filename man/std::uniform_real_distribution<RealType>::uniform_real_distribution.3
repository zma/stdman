.SH NAME
std::uniform_real_distribution<RealType>::uniform_real_distribution \- std::uniform_real_distribution<RealType>::uniform_real_distribution

.SH Synopsis
   uniform_real_distribution() : uniform_real_distribution(0.0) { }    \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit uniform_real_distribution( RealType a, RealType b = 1.0 ); \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit uniform_real_distribution( const param_type& params );     \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs a new distribution object. \fB(2)\fP uses a and b as the distribution parameters, \fB(3)\fP uses params as the distribution parameters.

.SH Parameters

   a      - the a distribution parameter (minimum value)
   b      - the b distribution parameter (maximum value)
   params - the distribution parameter set

.SH Notes

   Requires that a ≤ b and b-a ≤ std::numeric_limits<RealType>::max()

   If a == b, subsequent calls to the operator() overload that does not accept a param_type object will cause undefined behavior.

   To create a distribution over the closed interval [a,b], std::nextafter(b, std::numeric_limits<RealType>::max()) may be used as the second parameter.
