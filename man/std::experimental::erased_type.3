.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <experimental/utility>
  struct erased_type { };                   (library fundamentals TS)

  The struct erased_type is an empty struct that serves as a placeholder for a type in situations where the actual type is determined at runtime. For example, in classes that use type-erased_allocators, the nested typedef allocator_type is an alias for erased_type.
