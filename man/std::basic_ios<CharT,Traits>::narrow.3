.SH Synopsis

  char narrow( char_type c, char dfault ) const;

  Converts a current locale-specific character c to its standard equivalent. The result is converted from char_type to char if needed. If no conversion can be performed, the function returns dfault.
  Effectively calls std::use_facet< std::ctype<char_type> >(getloc()).narrow(c, dfault);.

.SH Parameters


  c      - character to convert
  dfault - character to return if the conversion was unsuccessful


.SH Return value

  Character converted to its standard equivalent and then to char. dfault is returned if the conversion fails.
