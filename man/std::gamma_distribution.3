.SH NAME
std::gamma_distribution \- std::gamma_distribution

.SH Synopsis

Defined in header <random>
template< class RealType = double >  \fI(since C++11)\fP
class gamma_distribution;

Produces random positive floating-point values x, distributed according to probability density function:

      \\(\\mathsf{p}(x\\mid\\alpha,\\beta) = \\frac{e^{-x/\\beta} }{\\beta^\\alpha\\cdot\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\cdot x^{\\alpha-1} \\)P(x|α,β) =

      e-x/β
      βα
      · Γ(α)

      · xα-1

where α is known as the shape parameter and β is known as the scale parameter. The shape parameter is sometimes denoted by the letter k and the scale parameter is sometimes denoted by the letter θ.
For floating-point α, the value obtained is the sum of α independent exponentially distributed random variables, each of which has a mean of β
std::gamma_distribution satisfies RandomNumberDistribution

.SH Template parameters


RealType - The result type generated by the generator. The effect is undefined if this is not one of float, double, or long double.



.SH Member types


Member type Definition
result_type RealType
param_type  the type of the parameter set, see RandomNumberDistribution.


.SH Member functions


              constructs new distribution
constructor   \fI(public member function)\fP
              resets the internal state of the distribution
reset         \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Generation

              generates the next random number in the distribution
operator()    \fI(public member function)\fP

.SH Characteristics

              returns the distribution parameters
alpha         \fI(public member function)\fP
beta
              gets or sets the distribution parameter object
param         \fI(public member function)\fP
              returns the minimum potentially generated value
min           \fI(public member function)\fP
