.SH NAME
std::strstream \- std::strstream

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <strstream>
   class strstream : public std::iostream  (deprecated in C++98)

   The class strstream implements input and output operations on array-backed streams. It essentially wraps a raw array I/O device implementation (std::strstreambuf) into the higher-level interface of std::basic_iostream.

   The typical implementation of strstream holds only one non-derived data member: an object of type std::strstreambuf.

.SH Notes

   After any call to str(), a call to freeze(false) is required to allow the destructor to deallocate the buffer as necessary.

   Before any call to str() that uses the result as a C string, the buffer must be null-terminated, typically with std::ends.

   strstream has been deprecated since C++98, std::stringstream and boost::iostreams::array are the recommended replacements.
