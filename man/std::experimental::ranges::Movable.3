.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::Movable \- std::experimental::ranges::Movable

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
  template < class T >
  concept bool Movable =
  std::is_object<T>::value &&                       (ranges TS)
  MoveConstructible<T> &&
  Assignable<T&, T> &&
  Swappable<T>;

  The concept Movable<T> specifies that T is an object type that can moved (that is, it can be move constructed, move assigned, and lvalues of type T can be swapped).
  There need not be any subsumption relationship between Movable<T> and std::is_object<T>::value.
