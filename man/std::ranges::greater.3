.SH NAME
std::ranges::greater \- std::ranges::greater

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <functional>
  struct greater;                 \fI(since C++20)\fP

  Function object for performing comparisons. Deduces the parameter types of the function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

  std::ranges::greater::operator()


  template< class T, class U >
  requires StrictTotallyOrderedWith<T, U> ||
  /* std::declval<T>() < std::declval<U>() resolves to
  a built-in operator comparing pointers */
  constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u) const;

  Compares t and u. Equivalent to return ranges::less{}(std::forward<U>(u), std::forward<T>(t));.

.SH Notes

  Unlike std::greater, std::ranges::greater requires all six comparison operators <, <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the StrictTotallyOrderedWith constraint) and is entirely defined in terms of std::ranges::less. However, the implementation is free to use operator> directly, because those concepts require the results of the comparison operators to be consistent.
