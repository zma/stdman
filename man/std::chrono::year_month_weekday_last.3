.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <chrono>
  class year_month_weekday_last;  \fI(since C++20)\fP

  The class year_month_weekday_last represents the last weekday of a specific year and month. It is a field-based time point, with a resolution of std::chrono::days, except that it is limited to pointing to the last weekday of a year and month. std::chrono::years- and std::chrono::months-oriented arithmetic are supported directly. An implicit conversion to std::chrono::sys_days allows std::chrono::days-oriented arithmetic to be performed efficiently.
  year_month_weekday_last is a TriviallyCopyable StandardLayoutType.
