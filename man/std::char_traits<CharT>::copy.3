.SH NAME
std::char_traits<CharT>::copy \- std::char_traits<CharT>::copy

.SH Synopsis

static char_type* copy( char_type* dest, const char_type* src, std::size_t count );            \fI(until C++20)\fP
static constexpr char_type* copy( char_type* dest, const char_type* src, std::size_t count );  \fI(since C++20)\fP

Copies count character from character string pointed to by src to character string pointed to by dest.
Formally, for each i in [0, count), performs assign(src[i], dest[i]).
The behavior is undefined if copied character ranges overlap, i.e. src is in [dest, dest + count).

.SH Parameters


dest  - pointer to a character string to copy to
src   - pointer to a character string to copy from
count - the number of characters to copy


.SH Return value

dest

.SH Exceptions

\fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

Linear.
