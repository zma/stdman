.TH std::strchr 3 "2020.03.24" "http://cppreference.com" "C++ Standard Libary"
.SH NAME
std::strchr \- std::strchr

.SH Synopsis

Defined in header <cstring>
const char* strchr( const char* str, int ch );
char* strchr( char* str, int ch );

Finds the first occurrence of the character static_cast<char>(ch) in the byte string pointed to by str.
The terminating null character is considered to be a part of the string and can be found if searching for '\\0'.

.SH Parameters


str - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed
ch  - character to search for


.SH Return value

Pointer to the found character in str, or a null pointer if no such character is found.

.SH Example


// Run this code

  #include <iostream>
  #include <cstring>

  int main()
  {
    const char *str = "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.";
    char target = 'T';
    const char *result = str;

    while ((result = std::strchr(result, target)) != NULL) {
      std::cout << "Found '" << target
                << "' starting at '" << result << "'\\n";

      // Increment result, otherwise we'll find target at the same location
      ++result;
    }
  }

.SH Output:

  Found 'T' starting at 'Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.'
  Found 'T' starting at 'There is no try.'
