.SH Synopsis

Defined in header <locale>
class locale::facet;

std::locale::facet is the base class for facets. It provides a common base class so that locales could store pointers to the facets they implement in a single indexed container, and it abstracts support for facet reference counting. Whenever a facet is added to a locale, the locale increments the reference count in the facet (through an implementation-specific mechanism). Whenever a locale is destructed or modified, it decrements the reference count in each facet it no longer implements. Whenever a facet's reference count becomes zero, the locale performs delete static_cast<std::locale::facet*>(f) where f is the pointer to the facet.
