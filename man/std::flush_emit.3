.SH NAME
std::flush_emit \- std::flush_emit

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <ostream>
  template< class CharT, class Traits >                                                    \fI(since C++20)\fP
  std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& flush_emit( std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>& os );

  Flushes the output sequence os as if by calling os.flush(). Then, if os.rdbuf() actually points to a std::basic_syncbuf<CharT, Traits, Allocator> buf, calls buf.emit().
  This is an output-only I/O manipulator, it may be called with an expression such as out << std::flush_emit for any out of type std::basic_ostream.


.SH Parameters


  os - reference to output stream


.SH Return value

  os (reference to the stream after manipulation)
