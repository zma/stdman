.SH Synopsis

  basic_iostream& operator=( const basic_iostream& other ) = delete; \fB(1)\fP
  protected:                                                         \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
  basic_iostream& operator=( basic_iostream&& other );

  Assigns another stream object.
  1) Copy assignment is not allowed.
  2) Move assigns another stream object. Effectively calls swap(rhs). This move assignment operator is protected: it is called by the move assignment operators of the derived stream classes std::basic_stringstream and std::basic_fstream which know how to properly move-assign the associated stream buffers.

.SH Parameters


  other - another stream to assign state of
