.SH NAME
std::filesystem::directory_options \- std::filesystem::directory_options

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <filesystem>
  enum class directory_options {
  none = /* unspecified */,
  follow_directory_symlink = /* unspecified */,  \fI(since C++17)\fP
  skip_permission_denied = /* unspecified */
  };

  This type represents available options that control the behavior of the directory_iterator and recursive_directory_iterator.
  directory_options satisfies the requirements of BitmaskType (which means the bitwise operators operator&, operator|, operator^, operator~, operator&=, operator|=, and operator^= are defined for this type). none represents the empty bitmask; every other enumerator represents a distinct bitmask element.
