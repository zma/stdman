.SH NAME
std::shared_ptr<T>::~shared_ptr \- std::shared_ptr<T>::~shared_ptr

.SH Synopsis

  ~shared_ptr();

  If *this owns an object and it is the last shared_ptr owning it, the object is destroyed through the owned deleter.
  After the destruction, the smart pointers that shared ownership with *this, if any, will report a use_count() that is one less than its previous value.

.SH Notes

  Unlike std::unique_ptr, the deleter of std::shared_ptr is invoked even if the managed pointer is null.
