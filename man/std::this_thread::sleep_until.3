.SH NAME
std::this_thread::sleep_until \- std::this_thread::sleep_until

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <thread>
  template< class Clock, class Duration >                                         \fI(since C++11)\fP
  void sleep_until( const std::chrono::time_point<Clock,Duration>& sleep_time );

  Blocks the execution of the current thread until specified sleep_time has been reached.
  The clock tied to sleep_time is used, which means that adjustments of the clock are taken into account. Thus, the duration of the block might, but might not, be less or more than sleep_time - Clock::now() at the time of the call, depending on the direction of the adjustment. The function also may block for longer than until after sleep_time has been reached due to scheduling or resource contention delays.

.SH Parameters


  sleep_time - time to block until


.SH Return value

  \fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

  Any exception thrown by Clock or Duration (clocks and durations provided by the standard library never throw)
