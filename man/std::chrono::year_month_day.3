std::chrono::year_month_day \- std::chrono::year_month_day

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <chrono>
   class year_month_day;       \fI(since C++20)\fP

   The class year_month_day represents a specific year, month, and day. It is a field-based time point, with a resolution of std::chrono::days. std::chrono::years- and std::chrono::months-oriented arithmetic are supported directly. An implicit conversion to and from std::chrono::sys_days allows std::chrono::days-oriented arithmetic to be performed efficiently.

   year_month_day is a TriviallyCopyable StandardLayoutType.
