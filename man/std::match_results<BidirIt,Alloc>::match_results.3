.SH Synopsis

  match_results() : match_results(Allocator()) { } \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
  explicit match_results( const Allocator& a );    \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
  match_results( const match_results& rhs );       \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
  match_results( match_results&& rhs ) noexcept;   \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

  1) Default-constructor. Constructs a match result with no established result state (ready() != true).
  2) Constructs a match result with no established result state (ready() != true) using a copy of a as the allocator.
  3) Copy-constructor. Constructs a match result with a copy of rhs.
  4) Move-constructor. Constructs a match result with the contents of rhs using move semantics. rhs is in valid, but unspecified state after the call.

.SH Parameters


  a   - allocator to use for all memory allocations of this container
  rhs - another match_result to use as source to initialize the match_result with


.SH Exceptions

  1-2) \fI(none)\fP
