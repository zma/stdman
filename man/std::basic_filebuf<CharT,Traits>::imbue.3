.SH NAME
std::basic_filebuf<CharT,Traits>::imbue \- std::basic_filebuf<CharT,Traits>::imbue

.SH Synopsis

  protected:
  virtual void imbue( const std::locale& loc )

  Changes the associated locale so that all characters inserted or extracted after this call (and until another call to imbue()) are converted using the std::codecvt facet of loc.
  If the old locale's encoding is state-dependent and file is not positioned at the beginning, then the new locale must have the same std::codecvt facet as the one previously imbued.

.SH Parameters


  loc - the locale to imbue the stream with
