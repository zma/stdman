.SH NAME
std::sig_atomic_t \- std::sig_atomic_t

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <csignal>
  typedef /* unspecified */ sig_atomic_t;

  An integer type which can be accessed as an atomic entity even in the presence of asynchronous interrupts made by signals.

.SH Notes

  Until C++11, which introduced std::atomic and std::atomic_signal_fence, about the only thing a strictly conforming program could do in a signal handler was to assign a value to a volatile static std::sig_atomic_t variable and promptly return.
