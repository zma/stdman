.SH NAME
std::binomial_distribution<IntType>::binomial_distribution \- std::binomial_distribution<IntType>::binomial_distribution

.SH Synopsis

  binomial_distribution() : binomial_distribution\fB(1)\fP {}        (1) \fI(since C++11)\fP
  explicit binomial_distribution( IntType t, double p = 0.5 ); \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
  explicit binomial_distribution( const param_type& params );  \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

  Constructs a new distribution object. \fB(2)\fP uses t and p as the distribution parameters. \fB(3)\fP uses params as the distribution parameters.

.SH Parameters


  t      - the t distribution parameter (number of trials)
  p      - the p distribution parameter (probability of a trial generating true)
  params - the distribution parameter set


.SH Notes

  Requires that 0 ≤ p ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ t.
