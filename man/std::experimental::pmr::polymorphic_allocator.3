.SH NAME
std::experimental::pmr::polymorphic_allocator \- std::experimental::pmr::polymorphic_allocator

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource>
   template< class T >                               (library fundamentals TS)
   class polymorphic_allocator;

   The class template std::experimental::pmr::polymorphic_allocator is an Allocator whose allocation behavior depends on the memory resource it is constructed with. Thus, different instances of polymorphic_allocator can exhibit entirely different allocation behavior. This runtime polymorphism allows objects using polymorphic_allocator to behave as if they used different allocator types at run time despite the identical static allocator type.
