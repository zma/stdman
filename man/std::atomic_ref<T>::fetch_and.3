.SH Synopsis

T fetch_and( T arg,                                                    \fI(since C++20)\fP
std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst ) const noexcept;  (member only of atomic_ref<Integral> template specialization)

Atomically replaces the current value of the referenced object with the result of bitwise AND of the value and arg. This operation is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the value of order.

.SH Parameters


arg   - the other argument of bitwise AND
order - memory order constraints to enforce


.SH Return value

The value of the referenced object, immediately preceding the effects of this function.
