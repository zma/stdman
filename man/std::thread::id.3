.SH Synopsis

Defined in header <thread>
class thread::id;           \fI(since C++11)\fP

The class thread::id is a lightweight, trivially copyable class that serves as a unique identifier of std::thread objects.
Instances of this class may also hold the special distinct value that does not represent any thread. Once a thread has finished, the value of std::thread::id may be reused by another thread.
This class is designed for use as key in associative containers, both ordered and unordered.
