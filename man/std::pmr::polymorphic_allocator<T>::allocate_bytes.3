.SH NAME
std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T>::allocate_bytes \- std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T>::allocate_bytes

.SH Synopsis

void* allocate_bytes( std::size_t nbytes,             \fI(since C++20)\fP
std::size_t alignment = alignof(std::max_align_t) );

Allocates nbytes bytes of storage at specified alignment alignment using the underlying memory resource. Equivalent to return resource()->allocate(nbytes, alignment);

.SH Parameters


nbytes    - the number of bytes to allocate
alignment - the alignment to use


.SH Return value

A pointer to the allocated storage.

.SH Notes

This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator std::polymorphic_allocator<>, but it may be useful in any specialization.
The return type is void* (rather than, e.g., std::byte*) to support conversion to an arbitrary pointer type U* by static_cast<U*>.

.SH Exceptions

May throw any exceptions thrown by the call to resource()->allocate.
