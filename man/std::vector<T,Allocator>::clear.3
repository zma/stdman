.SH NAME
std::vector<T,Allocator>::clear \- std::vector<T,Allocator>::clear

.SH Synopsis
   void clear();           \fI(until C++11)\fP
   void clear() noexcept;  \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Erases all elements from the container. After this call, size() returns zero.

   Invalidates any references, pointers, or iterators referring to contained elements. Any past-the-end iterators are also invalidated.

   Leaves the capacity() of the vector unchanged (note: the standard's restriction on the changes to capacity is in the specification of vector::reserve, see [1])

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Complexity

   Linear in the size of the container, i.e., the number of elements.
