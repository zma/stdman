.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <exception>
   std::unexpected_handler set_unexpected( std::unexpected_handler f ) throw();   \fI(until C++11)\fP
                                                                                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
   std::unexpected_handler set_unexpected( std::unexpected_handler f ) noexcept;  \fB(deprecated)\fP
                                                                                  (removed in C++17)

   Makes f the new global std::unexpected_handler and returns the previously installed std::unexpected_handler.

   This function is thread-safe. Every call to std::set_unexpected synchronizes-with (see std::memory_order) the subsequent calls to std::set_unexpected and std::get_unexpected \fI(since C++11)\fP

.SH Parameters

   f - pointer to function of type std::unexpected_handler, or null pointer

.SH Return value

   The previously-installed unexpected handler, or a null pointer value if none was installed.
