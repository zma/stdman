.SH NAME
std::chrono::tai_clock::from_utc \- std::chrono::tai_clock::from_utc

.SH Synopsis

  template <class Duration>
  static std::chrono::tai_time<std::common_type_t<Duration, std::chrono::seconds>>  \fI(since C++20)\fP
  from_utc(const std::chrono::utc_time<Duration>&) noexcept;

  Converts the utc_time t to a tai_time representing the same point in time.

.SH Return value

  A std::chrono::tai_time representing the same point in time as t, computed as if by constructing a value of the return type from t.time_since_epoch() and adding 378691210s. (378691210 is the number of seconds between the epochs of the two clocks: 1958-01-01 00:00:00 TAI and 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.)
