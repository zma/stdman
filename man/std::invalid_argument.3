.SH NAME
std::invalid_argument \- std::invalid_argument

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <stdexcept>
  class invalid_argument;

  Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors that arise because an argument value has not been accepted.
  This exception is thrown by std::bitset::bitset, and the std::stoi and std::stof families of functions.

                constructs the exception object
  constructor   \fI(public member function)\fP


   std::invalid_argument::invalid_argument


  explicit invalid_argument( const std::string& what_arg ); \fB(1)\fP
  explicit invalid_argument( const char* what_arg );        \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

  Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string that can be accessed through what().
  Because copying std::invalid_argument is not permitted to throw exceptions, this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

.SH Parameters


  what_arg - explanatory string


.SH Exceptions

  May throw std::bad_alloc

  Inherited from std::exception


.SH Member functions



  destructor   destroys the exception object
               \fI(virtual public member function of std::exception)\fP
  \fB[virtual]\fP

  what         returns an explanatory string
               \fI(virtual public member function of std::exception)\fP
  \fB[virtual]\fP


.SH Notes

  The purpose of this exception type is similar to the error condition std::errc::invalid_argument (thrown in std::system_error from member functions of std::thread) and the related errno constant EINVAL.
