.SH NAME
std::queue<T,Container>::emplace \- std::queue<T,Container>::emplace

.SH Synopsis

  template< class... Args >                  \fI(since C++11)\fP
  void emplace( Args&&... args );            \fI(until C++17)\fP
  template< class... Args >                  \fI(since C++17)\fP
  decltype(auto) emplace( Args&&... args );

  Pushes a new element to the end of the queue. The element is constructed in-place, i.e. no copy or move operations are performed. The constructor of the element is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to the function.
  Effectively calls c.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

.SH Parameters


  args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element


.SH Return value


  \fI(none)\fP                                                                                 \fI(until C++17)\fP
  The value or reference, if any, returned by the above call to Container::emplace_back. \fI(since C++17)\fP


.SH Complexity

  Identical to the complexity of Container::emplace_back.
