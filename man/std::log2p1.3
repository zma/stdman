.SH NAME
std::log2p1 \- std::log2p1

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <bit>
  template< class T >                \fI(since C++20)\fP
  constexpr T log2p1(T x) noexcept;

  If x is not zero, calculates the number of bits needed to store the value x, that is, \\(1 + \\lfloor log_2(x) \\rfloor\\)1 + floor(log
  2(x)). If x is zero, returns zero.
  This overload only participates in overload resolution if T is an unsigned integer type (that is, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, unsigned long long, or an extended unsigned integer type).

.SH Return value

  Zero if x is zero; otherwise, one plus the base-2 logarithm of x, with any fractional part discarded.
