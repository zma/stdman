.SH NAME
std::unordered_multiset<Key,Hash,KeyEqual,Allocator>::emplace \- std::unordered_multiset<Key,Hash,KeyEqual,Allocator>::emplace

.SH Synopsis

  template< class... Args >            \fI(since C++11)\fP
  iterator emplace( Args&&... args );

  Inserts a new element into the container constructed in-place with the given args .
  Careful use of emplace allows the new element to be constructed while avoiding unnecessary copy or move operations. The constructor of the new element is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to emplace, forwarded via std::forward<Args>(args)....

  If rehashing occurs due to the insertion, all iterators are invalidated. Otherwise iterators are not affected. References are not invalidated. Rehashing occurs only if the new number of elements is greater than max_load_factor()*bucket_count().

.SH Parameters


  args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element


.SH Return value

  Returns an iterator to the inserted element.

.SH Exceptions

  If an exception is thrown by any operation, this function has no effect.

.SH Complexity

  Amortized constant on average, worst case linear in the size of the container.
