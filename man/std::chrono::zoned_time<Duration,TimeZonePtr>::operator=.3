.SH Synopsis

  zoned_time& operator=(const zoned_time& other) = default;              \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
  zoned_time& operator=(const std::chrono::sys_time<Duration>& other);   \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
  zoned_time& operator=(const std::chrono::local_time<Duration>& other); \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP

  Assign the value of other to *this.
  1) Defaulted copy assignment operator. Copy-assigns both the stored time point and the stored time zone pointer. zoned_time has no move assignment operator; a move is a copy.
  2) Assigns other to the stored time point. The time zone pointer is unchanged. After this call, get_sys_time() == other.
  3) Converts other to a std::chrono::sys_time as if by zone->to_sys(other) (where zone is the non-static data member holding the stored time zone pointer) and assigns the result to the stored time point. The time zone pointer is unchanged. After this call, get_local_time() == other.

.SH Return value

  *this.
