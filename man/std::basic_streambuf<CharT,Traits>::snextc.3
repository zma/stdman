std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>::snextc \- std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>::snextc

.SH Synopsis

  int_type snextc();

  Advances the input sequence by one character and reads one character.
  The function calls sbumpc() to advance the input sequence. If that function returns Traits::eof() meaning that input sequence has been exhausted and uflow() could not retrieve more data, Traits::eof() is returned. Otherwise sgetc() is called in order to read the character.

.SH Parameters

  \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

  The value of the next character. If the input sequence has been exhausted, Traits::eof() is returned.
