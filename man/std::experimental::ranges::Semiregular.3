.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
  template <class T>                                                  (ranges TS)
  concept bool Semiregular = Copyable<T> && DefaultConstructible<T>;

  The Semiregular concept specifies that a type is both copyable and default constructible. It is satisfied by types that behave similarly to built-in types like int, except that they need not support comparison with ==.
