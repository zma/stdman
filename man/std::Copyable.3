.SH NAME
std::Copyable \- std::Copyable

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <concepts>
   template <class T>

   concept Copyable =
   std::CopyConstructible<T> &&    \fI(since C++20)\fP
   std::Movable<T> &&

   std::Assignable<T&, const T&>;

   The concept Copyable<T> specifies that T is an Movable object type that can also copied (that is, it supports copy construction and copy assignment).

.SH Notes

   It is intended that Copyable<T> also requires std::Assignable<T&, const T> (assignment from const rvalue) and std::Assignable<T&, T&> (assignment from non-const lvalue) to be satisfied.
