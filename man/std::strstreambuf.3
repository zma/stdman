.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <strstream>
   class strstreambuf : public std::basic_streambuf<char>  (deprecated in C++98)

   std::strstreambuf is a std::basic_streambuf whose associated character sequence is a character array, which may be constant (e.g. a string literal), modifyable but not dynamic (e.g. a stack-allocated array), or dynamic, in which case the std::strstreambuf may be allowed to reallocate the array as necessary to accomodate output (e.g. by calling delete[] and new[] or user-provided functions).

   Typical implementation of a std::strstreambuf holds four private data members:

   1) buffer state, a bitmask type which can represent any combination of the four values "allocated" (destructor will deallocate), "constant" (output not allowed), "dynamic" (output may reallocate), or "frozen" (deallocation and reallocation are not allowed)
   2) allocated buffer size (the beginning of the buffer does not need a special data member, it may be stored in the inherited pointer eback())
   3) pointer to user-provided allocation function
   4) pointer to user-provided deallocation function.

.SH Notes

   After any call to str() on a stream with a dynamic buffer, a call to freeze(false) is required to allow the strstreambuf destructor to deallocate the buffer when necessary.
