.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <chrono>
  class time_zone;            \fI(since C++20)\fP

  The class time_zone represents all time zone transitions for a specific geographic area.
  Users cannot construct time_zone objects. The library implementation creates time_zone objects when it initializes the time zone database and provides const access to these objects.
  time_zone is not copyable but does have a defaulted move constructor and a defaulted move assignment operator. However, as users have only const access to time_zone objects, these functions cannot be called in user code without invoking undefined_behavior.
