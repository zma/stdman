   Atomically increments or decrements the current value. The operation is read-modify-write operation.

   1) Performs atomic pre-increment. Equivalent to fetch_add\fB(1)\fP+1.
   2) Performs atomic post-increment. Equivalent to fetch_add\fB(1)\fP.
   3) Performs atomic pre-decrement. Equivalent to fetch_sub\fB(1)\fP-1
   4) Performs atomic post-decrement. Equivalent to fetch_sub\fB(1)\fP.

   For signed Integral types, arithmetic is defined to use twoâ€™s complement representation. There are no undefined results.

   For T* types, the result may be an undefined address, but the operations otherwise have no undefined behavior. The program is ill-formed if T is not an object type.

.SH Parameters

   \fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

   1,3) The value of the atomic variable after the modification. Formally, the result of incrementing/decrementing the value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of *this.
   2,4) The value of the atomic variable before the modification. Formally, the value immediately preceding the effects of this function in the modification order of *this.

.SH Notes

   Unlike most pre-increment and pre-decrement operators, the pre-increment and pre-decrement operators for atomic types do not return a reference to the modified object. They return a copy of the stored value instead.

  Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
