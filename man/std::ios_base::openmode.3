Specifies available file open flags. It is a BitmaskType, the following constants are defined:

app      seek to the end of stream before each write
binary   open in binary_mode
in       open for reading
out      open for writing
trunc    discard the contents of the stream when opening
ate      seek to the end of stream immediately after open
