std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T>::deallocate \- std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<T>::deallocate

.SH Synopsis

void deallocate(T* p, std::size_t n );  \fI(since C++17)\fP

Deallocates the storage pointed to by p, which must have been allocated from a std::pmr::memory_resource x that compares equal to *resource() using x.allocate(n * sizeof(T), alignof(T)).
Equivalent to this->resource()->deallocate(p, n * sizeof(T), alignof(T));
