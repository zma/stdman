   Constructs the pseudo-random number engine.

   1) Default constructor. Seeds the engine with default_seed.

   The overload \fB(3)\fP only participates in overload resolution if Sseq qualifies as a SeedSequence. In particular, it is excluded from the set of candidate functions if Sseq is convertible to result_type.

.SH Parameters

   value - seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state
   s     - seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state
