.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::greater_equal \- std::experimental::ranges::greater_equal

.SH Synopsis
   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/functional>
   template< class T = void >

   requires StrictTotallyOrdered<T> ||
   Same<T, void> ||                                                               (ranges TS)
   /* < on two const T lvalues invokes a built-in operator comparing pointers */

   struct greater_equal;
   template <>                                                                    (ranges TS)
   struct greater_equal<void>;

   Function object for performing comparisons. The primary template invokes operator< on const lvalues of type T and negates the result. The specialization greater_equal<void> deduces the parameter types of the function call operator from the arguments (but not the return type).

   All specializations of greater_equal are Semiregular.

std::experimental::ranges::greater_equal::operator()

   constexpr bool operator()(const T& x, const T& y) const; \fB(1)\fP (member only of primary greater_equal<T> template)
   template< class T, class U >

   requires StrictTotallyOrderedWith<T, U> ||
   /* std::declval<T>() < std::declval<U>() resolves to     \fB(2)\fP (member only of greater_equal<void> specialization)
   a built-in operator comparing pointers */

   constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u) const;

   1) Compares x and y. Equivalent to return !ranges::less<>{}(x, y);
   2) Compares t and u. Equivalent to return !ranges::less<>{}(std::forward<T>(t), std::forward<U>(u));.

.SH Notes

   Unlike std::greater_equal, ranges::greater_equal requires all six comparison operators <, <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the StrictTotallyOrdered and StrictTotallyOrderedWith constraints) and is entirely defined in terms of ranges::less. However, the implementation is free to use operator>= directly, because those concepts require the results of the comparison operators to be consistent.
