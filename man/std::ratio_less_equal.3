.SH NAME
std::ratio_less_equal \- std::ratio_less_equal

.SH Synopsis

Defined in header <ratio>
template< class R1, class R2 >                     \fI(since C++11)\fP
struct ratio_less_equal : std::integral_constant;

If the ratio R1 is less than or equal to the ratio R2, provides the member constant value equal true. Otherwise, value is false.

Helper variable template


template< class R1, class R2 >                                               \fI(since C++17)\fP
inline constexpr bool ratio_less_equal_v = ratio_less_equal<R1, R2>::value;


Inherited from std::integral_constant
