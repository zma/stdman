.SH NAME
std::experimental::ranges::StrictWeakOrder \- std::experimental::ranges::StrictWeakOrder

.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
  template < class R, class T, class U >            \fB(1)\fP (ranges TS)
  concept bool StrictWeakOrder = Relation<R, T, U>;

  The concept StrictWeakOrder<R, T, U> specifies that the Relation R imposes a strict weak ordering on its arguments. A relation r is a strict weak ordering if

  * it is irreflexive: for all x, r(x, x) is false;
  * it is transitive: for all a, b and c, if r(a, b) and r(b, c) are both true then r(a, c) is true;
  * let e(a, b) be !r(a, b) && !r(b, a), then e is transitive: e(a, b) && e(b, c) implies e(a, c).

  Under these conditions, it can be shown that e is an equivalence relation, and r induces a strict total ordering on the equivalence classes determined by e.

.SH Notes

  The distinction between Relation and StrictWeakOrder is purely semantic.
