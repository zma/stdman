.SH NAME
std::bernoulli_distribution::bernoulli_distribution \- std::bernoulli_distribution::bernoulli_distribution

.SH Synopsis
   bernoulli_distribution() : bernoulli_distribution(0.5) { }   \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit bernoulli_distribution( double p );                 \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP
   explicit bernoulli_distribution( const param_type& params ); \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++11)\fP

   Constructs new distribution object. \fB(2)\fP uses p as the distribution parameter. \fB(3)\fP uses params as the distribution parameter.

.SH Parameters

   p      - the p distribution parameter (probability of generating true)
   params - the distribution parameter set
