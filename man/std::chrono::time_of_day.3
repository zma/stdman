.SH Synopsis

  Defined in header <chrono>
  template< class Duration >                             \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
  class time_of_day; // not defined

  class time_of_day<std::chrono::hours>;
  template<>                                             \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
  class time_of_day<std::chrono::minutes>;
  template<>                                             \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
  class time_of_day<std::chrono::seconds>;
  template< class Rep, class Period >                    \fB(5)\fP \fI(since C++20)\fP
  class time_of_day<std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period>>;

  The class template time_of_day splits a std::chrono::duration representing time since midnight into a "broken down" time such as hours:minutes:seconds, with the precision of the split determined by the Duration template parameter. It also tracks whether it should be output in a 12-hour time format or a 24-hour time format. It is primarily a formatting tool.
  The primary template \fB(1)\fP is not defined; four specializations are provided to handle four different levels of precision.
  Each specialization of time_of_day is a TriviallyCopyable StandardLayoutType.
  The partial specialization \fB(5)\fP only exists if std::chrono::treat_as_floating_point_v<Rep> is false and std::chrono::duration<Rep, Period> is not convertible to std::chrono::seconds.
