.SH NAME
std::timed_mutex::unlock \- std::timed_mutex::unlock

.SH Synopsis

void unlock();  \fI(since C++11)\fP

Unlocks the mutex.
The mutex must be locked by the current thread of execution, otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
This operation synchronizes-with (as defined in std::memory_order) any subsequent lock operation that obtains ownership of the same mutex.

.SH Parameters

\fI(none)\fP

.SH Return value

\fI(none)\fP

.SH Exceptions

\fI(none)\fP

.SH Notes

unlock() is usually not called directly: std::unique_lock and std::lock_guard are used to manage exclusive locking.
