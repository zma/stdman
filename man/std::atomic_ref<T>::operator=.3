.SH Synopsis

  T operator=( T desired ) const noexcept;             \fB(1)\fP
  atomic_ref& operator=( const atomic_ref& ) = delete; \fB(2)\fP

  1) Atomically assigns a value desired to the referenced object. Equivalent to store(desired).
  2) atomic_ref is not CopyAssignable.

.SH Parameters

.SH Notes

  Unlike most assignment operators, the assignment operator for atomic_ref does not return a reference to its left-hand argument. It returns a copy of the stored value instead.
