.SH Synopsis

constexpr size_type find(basic_string_view v, size_type pos = 0) const noexcept; \fB(1)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
constexpr size_type find(CharT ch, size_type pos = 0) const noexcept;            \fB(2)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
constexpr size_type find(const CharT* s, size_type pos, size_type count) const;  \fB(3)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP
constexpr size_type find(const CharT* s, size_type pos = 0) const;               \fB(4)\fP \fI(since C++17)\fP

Finds the first substring equal to the given character sequence.
1) Finds the first occurence of v in this view, starting at position pos.
2) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(std::addressof(ch), 1), pos).
3) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(s, count), pos).
4) Equivalent to find(basic_string_view(s), pos).

.SH Parameters


v     - view to search for
pos   - position at which to start the search
count - length of substring to search for
s     - pointer to a character string to search for
ch    - character to search for



.SH Return value

Position of the first character of the found substring, or npos if no such substring is found.

.SH Complexity

O(size() * v.size()) at worst.
